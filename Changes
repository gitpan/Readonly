	   loading Carp.pm until it's needed.

0.06  2002 June 16
        - Add Readonly function, to provide a unified (and shorter) way to
          create readonly variables. (Thanks to Slaven Rezic for the idea).
        - Scalar, Array, and Hash now mark entire data structures as Readonly.
          Added Scalar1, Array1, and Hash1 for shallow Readonly protection.
          (Thanks to Ernest Lergon for the idea).
        - Switch to Test::More and Test::Harness.  134 tests now!
